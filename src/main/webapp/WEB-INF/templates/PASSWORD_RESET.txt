Hi {name},

Someone requested that the password for your Monterrey Portal account be reset.

Click in the link below. You can also copy this link to the address bar of you browser:

{host}/Pollux/Controller?nav=ChangePassword.nav&redirect=true&page=prelogin&reference={token}

This link will only work until today at midnight and can only be used once. 

If you didn't request this, you can ignore this email or let us know. Your password won't change until you create a new password.

Regards,

Monterrey Body corporate
